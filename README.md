## Description

MedMed is an awesome application that allows doctors and patients to manage complicated prescription regimens. A doctor can add a patient, assign them a prescription, and monitor their patient's compliance. A patient can see what scheduled medication they have to take, report any side effects they might have, and receive text reminders.
